# Quera Problem Solutions
## About This Repository

This repository contains a collection of problems from [Quera](https://quera.org) that I have personally solved using my own understanding and knowledge. The goal is to share clean and understandable solutions with minimal reliance on external libraries.

### Key Points

- For each problem, solutions are provided in multiple programming languages, mainly **Python** and **C/C++**.
- Due to differences in syntax and capabilities of each language, the implementation details may vary.
- All submitted solutions have received a full score (100) on Quera. However, there may still exist more optimal approaches.
- All solutions are organized in the `problems` directory. Each subdirectory is named after the corresponding problem ID on Quera.  
  For example, the folder `282` contains the solution for the following problem:  
  [https://quera.org/problemset/282](https://quera.org/problemset/282)
- Inside each problem folder, solution files are named `solution` with the appropriate file extension based on the programming language used (e.g., `solution.py`, `solution.cpp`).
