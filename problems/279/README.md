# Brief Explanation:

In this program, the goal is to compute the value of the following binomial expression:
$\sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} \cdot x^k \cdot a^{n-k}$

Two different methods are used to solve the same problem, which is to calculate the value of the expression ((x + a)^n). Below is a brief explanation of both approaches:

---

## **First Method – Using Binomial Expansion**

This method uses the binomial expansion formula:
$\sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} \cdot x^k \cdot a^{n-k}$

* The `factorial` function is used to calculate the binomial coefficient (\binom{n}{k}).
* The `power` function is used to compute powers of `x` and `a`.
* A `for` loop iterates through values of `k` from 0 to `n`, calculates each term, and adds it to the total `sum`.

> **Advantage:** Helps understand how the binomial expansion works step by step.

## **Second Method – Direct Mathematical Computation**

This method simply computes the value of ((x + a)^n) directly using the `power` function:

$\(x + a)^n$

> **Advantage:** Much simpler and faster. It's more efficient, especially for large values of `n`.

## Conclusion:

* **First method** is educational and demonstrates the process of binomial expansion.
* **Second method** is more practical and efficient for real-world applications.
